AndroidUtils
============
Several utils which can be useful for someone writing Android Apps

 - WakelockManager is a utility class to pass WakeLocks from BroadcastReceiver to a Service. This saves you the trouble to pass it by hand and care about leaking WakeLocks.
 - Logger is a utility to simplify logging. Af for now, all log messages have autogenerated tag [class.methodname]. Log lovel can be configured per class on runtime.
 - Hierarchical state machine which processes messages and can have states arranged hierarchically. This is a state machine from Android framework, which is up until now is an internal class (non-public API). Since this tool is very useful, it has to be easily reached :-) SM contains small logging modifications made by me. Apart from that, it is the same as implementation in AOSP.
